\title{Simulate mixed related SNP distance dataset}
\usage{
simulate_mixsnp_data(
  lambda,
  k,
  unrel_mean = 25,
  unrel_sd = 12.5,
  error_param = NA,
  n = 100,
  rel_timemax = 1,
  rel_timemin = 0,
  right_truncation = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lambda}{mutation rate input (SNPs per year)}

\item{k}{proportion of mixed dataset that is linked, set to 0 to produce a distant dataset}

\item{unrel_mean}{mean of gamma distribution for which the evolutionary time for the unrelated datapoints are chosen}

\item{unrel_sd}{sd of gamma distribution for which the evolutionary time for the unrelated datapoints are chosen}

\item{error_param}{chance that each SNP is missed. For simulating systematic error.}

\item{n}{size of dataset to simulate}

\item{rel_timemax}{maximum time allowed between samples in years (calculates time difference from uniform dist.)}

\item{rel_timemin}{minimum time allowed between samples in years}

\item{right_truncation}{maximum allowed SNP distances, if set too low can cause all SNP distances to be 0}
}
\value{
SNP distance dataset with a mixture of related and unrelated pairs with time differences
}
