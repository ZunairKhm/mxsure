\usage{
mxsure_likelihood(
  mixed_snp_dist,
  unrelated_snp_dist,
  mixed_time_dist,
  mixed_sites = NA,
  right_truncation = 2000,
  original_result = NA,
  start_params = NA,
  tree = NA,

  sampleB = NA,
  branch_offset = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mixed_snp_dist}{vector of SNP distances from mixed dataset}

\item{unrelated_snp_dist}{vector of SNP distances from unrelated dataset}

\item{mixed_time_dist}{vector of time differences for each SNP distacne in the mixed dataset}

\item{mixed_sites}{vector of sites considered for each SNP distance in the mixed dataset}

\item{right_truncation}{maximum limit of SNP distances to consider}

\item{original_result}{optional input to provide original mxsure_likelyhood() result instead of computing it again}

\item{start_params}{initial parameters for lambda, k, and intercept parameters for optimisation. If NA (as default) will try a range of different start parameters and produce the highest likelihood result}

\item{tree}{SNP-scaled phylogenetic tree or list of trees with pairs of tips labelled with sampleA and sampleB. If this is supplied a different model for related SNP distances will be fit that takes into account branch length differences to the MRCA for any given pair of samples provided in sampleA and sampleB.}

\item{sampleA}{tip labels for sampleA; must be in the correct order with respect to sampleB such that the time distance is calculated as SampleA date-SampleB date (even if this allows for negative numbers)}

\item{sampleB}{tip labels for sampleB; see above}

\item{branch_offset}{overide to branch offset to each skellam parameter for divergence correction model}
}
\value{
